# long_summary
In this lecture, the state of metaphysics during Kant's era is discussed, highlighting the prevalent skepticism towards its utility in the face of advancing science and mathematics. Yet, Kant insisted on the inevitability and necessity of metaphysical inquiry, likening its abandonment to ceasing to breathe to avoid impure air. Jonathan Bennett even critically considered much of Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason' as prima facie dead, but there has been significant scholarly engagement with the work since then, suggesting that the 'dead letter' diagnosis was premature. Kant found that both friends and critics often misunderstood his first edition, resulting in him displaying frustration and criticizing such incompetence. His writings before 'Critique' show a struggle with developing the correct model for his philosophical project, trying to reconcile the empirical and rationalistic approaches in philosophy influenced by Newton and Leibniz. The impetus for 'Critique' came from the recognition that, while human reason seeks knowledge, no one had critically assessed reason itself, which Kant saw as needed to test the extent and limits of our knowledge. Sebastian Gardner even postulated that virtually every sentence in Kant's work presents challenges, causing many commentaries to become extensive without fully addressing the work's content. With this background, Kant's own interests and educational journey to his project are discussed in detail. He posed a fundamental question: 'How is nature possible?', reflecting on the law-governed aspect of our experience despite the bombardment of sensory data. Kant's project is about ascertaining the conditions for the possibility of knowledge, particularly scientific knowledge, and resolving the tension between skepticism and the reliability of senses and reason. The lecturer also discusses similarities between Kant and the Scottish Common Sense School, noting the possibility of Kant's engagement with Thomas Reid's works and the larger philosophical conflict in German philosophy between systematic philosophy and a more populist, accessible approach. Finally, the lecturer notes contemporary relevance of Kantian ideas in the field of physics, affirming the ongoing influence of Kant’s philosophical thought.
