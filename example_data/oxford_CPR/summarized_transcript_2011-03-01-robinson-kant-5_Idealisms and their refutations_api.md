# short_summary
Kant's transcendental idealism, distinct from Barclay's and Descartes' skepticism, asserts that our internal perceptions and self awareness necessitate and prove the existence of an external reality. Kant's philosophy establishes that space and time are preconditions for thought, necessary for determining our existence and not merely subject to our sensibility, thus affirming a non-subjective, objective world.

# sentences
1. Kant is not an idealist and his refutation of idealism is a pivotal addition to the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason.
2. Kant distinguishes between sensibility (source of sensuous data) and understanding (categorizes and organizes thoughts).
3. Primary qualities (Locke) are directly accessible attributes like solidity and extension, whereas secondary qualities (color, sound) arise from the object's impact on our perception.
4. Reid's direct realism counters Locke's representationalism, asserting that objects in the external world are as we perceive them.
5. Barclay argued for a form of idealism where to be is to be perceived, countering the existence of a mind-independent material world.
6. Descartes' method of doubt questioned the certainty of an external world, positing that he might be dreaming or deceived by an evil demon, but still concludes there must be some external source.
7. Hume dismissed the possibility that reason could establish a connection between perceptions and external objects.
8. Kant argues that inner sense and self-awareness require an awareness of an external world, using this to counter idealism.
9. He proposes that the 'permanent' in perception, necessary for time-determination, is provided by space, validating external reality.
10. Kant's transcendental idealism is distinct from other forms of idealism as it affirms a necessary, externally grounded structure for thought.
11. His argument against idealism is designed to prove the existence and necessity of objects in space outside of ourselves, defying any idealist notion that bodies are merely illusion.
12. Kant sees the contents of consciousness as representations only, affirming that space and time are only sensible forms of intuition, not conditions of objects as things in themselves.
13. Knowledge a priori, for Kant, is absolutely independent of all experience and essential for the certainty that counters skepticism.
14. Time determination of internal life of the mind presupposes something static, which Kant identifies as the spatial framework.
15. Kant understands that accepting access to noumenal reality leads to a severe skepticism, defeating any knowledge claims.
16. He describes 'soul' as an ongoing flux, only with the 'I' being something permanent but not substantive.
17. Kant claims that self-consciousness requires perceptual awareness of objects external to oneself, an intellectual necessity.
18. The talk suggests that self consciousness cannot exist without a permanent external world as a framework.
19. Kant's position established that there was a fundamental objective agreement between cognitive representations and external reality.
20. The lecture ends with the acknowledgement of the expansive secondary literature on Kant, with self consciousness as a central theme.

# long_summary
The discussion highlights the complexities of Immanuel Kant's philosophy and its relationship to idealism. Initially, it is stated that Kant's reputation on idealism is substantive, notably with his refutation of idealism in the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, which emphasizes Kant's own brand of transcendental idealism. According to Kant, while sensuous intuitions provide the raw data of our experiences, they must be organized by the pure categories of understanding to form coherent thoughts. Without the pure intuitions of space and time, we would not be receptive to external events, and without the pure categories, our understanding would be incomplete. Kant's principles of understanding are such that much of cognition is beyond conscious control, which some have argued involves subjectivism and leads to skepticism. The issue is that our understanding and synthesizing could be entirely of our own making, which leads back to skepticism regarding the external world’s existence, an embarrassment that persisted since the time of Descartes. The talk then turns to a historic overview of the philosophy of knowledge in relation to the external world, starting with John Locke, who distinguished between primary and secondary qualities of objects, and Thomas Reid's direct realism, which opposes Locke's and Descartes' representationalism. Barclay (George Berkeley) famously argued that perception is mediated and that existence is dependent on being perceived, which essentially dissolves Locke’s distinction. Descartes, though unsure whether his perceptions are dreams or real, maintains that they must come from sources outside himself. Hume, on the other hand, argues that our perceptions cannot be proven to connect with external objects, dismissing any a priori synthetic knowledge and leaving reason in relation to the knowable world impoverished. Kant needed to demonstrate that his transcendental idealism does not fall into the skepticism of idealism like that of Descartes or Barclay. Kant's solution was that our inner sense of self-awareness requires perception of the external world, and this refutation of idealism concludes that external objects must exist as a necessary precondition for the organization of our conscious experience in time, affirming a reality beyond our internal perceptions. Kant stresses the necessity and universality of these a priori conditions, distancing himself from any form of standard idealism and rejecting the notion that body is merely illusion.
