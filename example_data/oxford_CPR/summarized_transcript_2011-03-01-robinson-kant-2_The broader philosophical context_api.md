# short_summary
Immanuel Kant aimed to establish metaphysics as a science with universal, necessary truths independent of sensory experience, countering empiricist skepticism from figures like Hume. He sought a priori synthetic knowledge in metaphysics, as found in mathematics and sciences, while criticizing those who reduced metaphysics to psychological or physical aspects of human experience.

# long_summary
Immanuel Kant, in his critical philosophy, was determined to elevate metaphysics to the rank of sciences like mathematics and empirical science which possess systematic and universal principles. He was critical of figures like Hume, who emphasized empirical experience as the principal source of knowledge, leaving metaphysics stagnated with speculative theories. Kant's ambition was to find universal and necessary truths, pure from empirical data, that could ground metaphysical inquiries into existence and knowledge. Kant's approach to metaphysics was not psychological but was supposed to be purely rational, non-empirical—in other words, purely based on reason itself rather than sensory experience or the peculiarities of human psychology. Kant's larger philosophical project was to restore dignity to metaphysics, address fundamental ontological and epistemological questions, and uncover a way out of the endless disputes and skeptical challenges posed by empiricism. He wanted to find a priori synthetic judgments, something Hume deemed impossible since for Hume, knowledge of the world came solely from sensory experience (a posteriori) and was prone to mistakes, not universally certain. Kant argued that there are already known synthetic a priori propositions in mathematics and sciences—he cited that every number can have one added to it as one example. The challenge was to prove that metaphysical knowledge could also have a similar form of universally necessary truth, something Kant strived for in his 'Critique of Pure Reason'.

During his exploration of various thinkers, Kant frequently referred back to historical figures like Aristotle, who was fundamental to the development of formal logic, the foundation of principled thought. The distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions was central to Kant's philosophy, where he aimed to show that metaphysics requires pure principles that aren't reliant on empirical observations. Furthermore, Kant criticized the notion that metaphysical disputes could be settled by examining the human condition or cultural forms of thought. His aim was to find pure aspects of understanding that transcend empirical reality, a non-psychological and non-physiological foundation, to preserve the necessity and universality that science takes for granted. 

Reflecting upon the thinking of precursors like Leibniz and Christian Wulf, Kant pointed out that while they were close to recognizing the need for critical assessment of the human mind and the principles governing cognition, they did not go as far as he wanted: to critique of pure reason itself. He highlighted that without such a grounding critique, empirical truths remain contingent and unable to present a complete, systematic understanding of the world. His ambition was to render experience intelligible through a priori reason, not just sensible through empirical data. Kant was also critical of the British empiricists like Locke, Barclay, and Hume, who influenced much of the thought against which he was reacting.

Kant's influence on metaphysical thinking and his response to Hume extend beyond mere academic discourse. He entered a prize competition held by the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1762, which questioned whether metaphysical truths could be demonstrated with the same certainty as mathematical ones. Kant finished second in the competition, which was won by Moses Mendelssohn. This anecdote illustrates not only Kant's active engagement in the intellectual debates of his time but also the practical and societal concerns surrounding metaphysics and its role in understanding nature, science, and morality.
